1) We will work with a dead man:
we will have to revive the old math club "Shuniya" because it is alive in the other campus:
So no-renaming :(

2) how will it revive:
Any member or I will have to write a mail to the Entity responsible for this, that is only after the ESA.

3) Members:
I was told that 10 is a good number of members. I was also told that it is a good thing to have 2 seniors (by that I mean people form higher sems and not H C Verma).

4) what do we do
One thing that we must have are "ideathon", get school students and teach them math  
and we can add more... 
If we make our club before November then we may have and opportunity to host one or more events in the "Nation mathematic day" month and it can not be the same as that from the last year.
